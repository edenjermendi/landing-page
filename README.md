# eden j. Landing Page

Hi, I’m Eden 

This is my personal [landing page](https://edenjermendi.github.io/landing-page/) where I’m learning to code and slowly customizing things to reflect myself and my future freelance brand.

## About This Project

This page started as a basic landing page from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. Since then, I’ve been:

- Changing the colors to match my own style
- Organizing and cleaning up the CSS
- Learning how to merge branches and push changes live
- Making my hero section fully responsive
- Experimenting with images, borders, and layout tweaks

Everything you see here is part of me learning and practicing web development from scratch.

## Still To Do

I’m still actively working on this page. Some things I plan to add next:

- Showcase my projects below in the **Features** section
- Update the CTA text and button to link to specific things (like my GitHub or a portfolio)
- Customize the header with proper navigation links
- Maybe add animations or subtle effects as I learn more
- Continue improving responsiveness for mobile and desktop

## Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (vanilla, no frameworks)
- Git & GitHub
- Basic JavaScript for interactivity (buttons)

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript basics
- Building and customizing projects for my portfolio

This page is my playground for experimenting, making mistakes, and improving my skil
