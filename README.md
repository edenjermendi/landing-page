## ðŸŒ± About This Project

This page started as a basic landing page from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. Since then, Iâ€™ve been:

- Changing the colors to match my own style
- Organizing and cleaning up the CSS
- Learning how to merge branches and push changes live
- Making my hero section fully responsive
- Experimenting with images, borders, and layout tweaks

Everything you see here is part of me learning and practicing web development from scratch.
